## Local development

App requires the following environment variables

`CLIENT_ID` - Client ID from [Google Developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis). This is the bit before the `v3.apps.googleusercontent.com` part. Google calender API and Google+ should be enabled for this to work.

`CLIENT_SECRET` - Client secret generated by [Google Developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)

`COOKIE_PASSWORD` - This can be anything you want, it's just used to encrypt the session cookie

```
npm install
npm start
```

App will be served at `http://localhost:8000`, or another port defined in  `PORT` environment variable
